## Coding Style Guide
**Note:** Some of the bellow are new, refactor the code to match the style guide where you see inconsistency.
- Don't use relative imports.
- We are using MUI v5, the all stylings must be applied with the new system. 
- Never use the `style` prop, there's always a cleaner solution with `sx` or `styled`.
